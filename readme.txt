Sorting Script

This script will sort a list of names by length in ascending order, and then sort alphabetically, and 
diplay the output in the command line. This script will only sort the one text document, 'Sort Me.txt'
according to the assignment. To run it without the command line, double click the script and it will output the 
sorted list directly, or navigate to the '\dist\sortme' folder and double click the application. 
To run from the command line: 
If python is installed, you can simply navigate to the sortme.py file and type
'python 3 sortme.py'. To run the executable version, you can also navigate to '\dist\sortme' and type './sortme.exe'. 
If this does not work, first run the command 'chmod a+x sortme.exe', then run './sortme.exe'.
